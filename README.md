# MoveDirectory

Simple Python code to move the entire directory structure including folders and Subfolders

│
├── MainFolder/
|   │
│   ├── SubFolder_A/
│   │   └── Doc_Raza.docx
│   │   └── Nabiha_Raza.pdf
│   │   
│   ├── SubFolder_B/
│   │
│   └── Pakistan.txt
|
└── test_file.csv



So everything is this entire directory will be copied as it is and pasted into another directory!
I have written it for a single time but we can recursively also fetch the files and paste it!
Just a loop away
